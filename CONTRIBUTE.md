## Triaging Issues

One way to contribute is to triage issues. This could be as simple as confirming a bug, or as complicated as debugging errors and providing fixes. A tiny bit of effort in someone else's issue can go a long way.

## Feature Requests

You can request a new feature by [submitting an issue](#filing-an-issue) to our repo. If you would like to implement a new feature then consider what kind of change it is:

* **Major Changes** that you wish to contribute to the project should be discussed first in an issue so that we can better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
* **Small Changes** can be crafted and submitted as a Pull Request.
