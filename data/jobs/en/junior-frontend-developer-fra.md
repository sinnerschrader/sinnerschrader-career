Moin! ⚓️

We’re glad you’re here because that means that you might be interested in building strong relationships with our clients and working on various projects with us. So, let’s not waste any time and find out if it could be a match!

*Who are we?*

We are one of Europe's leading digital agencies focusing on the design and development of digital products and services. More than 600 employees work on the digital transformation for global players. SinnerSchrader was founded in 1996 and has offices in Hamburg, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Munich and Prague. SinnerSchrader has been part of Accenture Interactive since April 2017.

We are currently looking for a **Junior Frontend Developer (f/m/d/-)** at our location in Frankfurt.

*We just go for it!* 🙌🏻

One of our pulses, as we call them here at SinnerSchrader, we live and work by.

But who are our employers? Josefine is one of our Junior Developers and not too long ago, she found herself in a similar position as you do now. Take a look [here](https://dev.to/s2engineers/the-first-step-is-always-the-hardest-first-impressions-of-a-junior-product-engineer-at-sinnerschrader-e3g) 🔍 to read about why she decided to start working with us and a general personal impression.

*"No one expects you to be able to do or know everything, whether you are a junior or been developing for years."*

### What is important?

We won't ask you “where do you see yourself in 10 years”, we don't need 1202081 years of experience, 7 university degrees and 5 Olympic medals (although it would be pretty impressive). We're looking for instantly motivated people who like to create, intuitive, responsive, high-performance user interfaces that follow our principle of “User. First. Period”. Overall, you will have the opportunity to shape advertising campaigns of global players and work on various exciting projects. And what technologies are we currently using? For instance JavaScript (ES6), TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, React, GraphQL, AWS, Redux, MobX, styled components... and many more.

### What else?
