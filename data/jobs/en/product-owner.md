### About you

As a product owner, your primary mission is to focus on effectiveness and creating the most loveable product for your users. Together with our German client, you are responsible for the innovation and further development of a car-connected app. You are able to co-create a product vision, manage the backlog and enjoy the active communication with all relevant stakeholders.

You are supported by a team of passionate specialists across the disciplines of UX and UI Design, Development, and QA. You are also helping them to understand what to build, why and how to deliver value continuously, not just in sprint release cycles :) You actively participate in the self-organisation of your agile team, you take reasonable risks and learn through failure and self-reflection. You further understand what your product‚Äôs design needs to remain sound and you are able to value stability as the core basis of performance.
