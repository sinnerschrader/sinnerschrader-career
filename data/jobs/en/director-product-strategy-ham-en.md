You look radically through the eyes of the user and develop beneficial and innovative solutions that make our everyday lives easier and, above all, better.

- Enjoy working in multidisciplinary agency and client teams with a deep understanding of a highly agile work environment
- Experience and methodological knowledge for a broad strategic remit - from analysis and research to ideation, experience design and digital business strategy
- Confidence in creating convincing presentations and workshop set-ups - and successfully representing them in front of clients
- Responsibility in developing the potential of employees

## Who we are:

- You will be part of an international team of strategists with different backgrounds, from sociologists to pure product strategists, from cultural omnivores to pure economists.
- The broad spectrum of strategic skills that we combine as a team today is due to our individual experiences, skills and cultural backgrounds.
- With our diverse backgrounds, we manage to understand our clients, our clients' clients, colleagues and bots, connect them and translate the different requirements and "languages"

## What we offer:

- The opportunity to contribute your skills to a variety of projects, always with the ambition to define the "NEXT" in our digital world.
- A professional and experienced team that works closely together and constantly strives to discover new things and change things.
