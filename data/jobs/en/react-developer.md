SinnerSchrader is looking for a React focused JavaScript developer. As part of our cross-functional Scrum teams, you will be working on existing and new React applications.

We develop applications using Javascript, React and other JS-Frameworks, as well as APIs and other backend systems using node.js. We write automated tests for our applications and use Redux and TypeScript, among others.

In addition to project work, we enjoy swapping ideas on the latest themes with other colleagues, discussing different ways of solving things in cross-project code reviews, driving forward Open Source projects and attending conferences. We have flexible working hours, work from home, and a workers council.

Have we sparked your interest? Then please get in touch.
