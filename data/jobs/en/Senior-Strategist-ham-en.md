We are currently looking for a **Senior Strategist (f/m/x/-)** for our Hamburg office.
 
We are looking for strategists who want to transform the digital transformation. Strategists who shape and revolutionise the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative flair. You look radically through the eyes of the user and develop beneficial and innovative solutions that make our everyday lives easier and, above all, better. Therefore, service and experience design are just as much your playing field as the classic strategy repertoire. You have a keen sense for brands and their business challenges in the digital age. And you have outstanding communicative and methodical skills and an analytical and inspiring mind.

## What you should bring with you:
- Passion for digital topics - from use cases, vision setting to organisational structures.
- 4-6 years of strategy or service design experience in an agency or in the area of strategic client consulting in a consultancy firm
- Enjoy working in multi-disciplinary agency and client teams with a deep understanding of a highly agile work environment
- Experience and methodological knowledge for a broad strategic remit - from analysis to experience design and digital business strategy
- Confidence in creating compelling presentations and workshop set-ups - and successfully representing them to clients

## Who we are:
- You will be part of an international team of strategists with diverse backgrounds, from sociologists to pure product strategists, from cultural omnivores to pure economists.
- The broad spectrum of strategic skills that we combine as a team today is due to our individual experiences, skills and cultural backgrounds.
- With our diverse backgrounds, we are able to understand our clients, our clients' clients, colleagues and bots, to connect them and to translate the different requirements and "languages".
- As diverse and varied as our backgrounds and skills are, so is the role you take on as a strategist. You shape your own role and place

## This is what we offer:
- Exciting and innovative projects with well-known companies
- Varied tasks and room for personal responsibility
- Professional and personal development, creative exchange with your strategy team and the SinnerSchrader team
- Great benefits, a pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes

Please send us your application documents exclusively by e-mail to <jobs@sinnerschrader.com>. We look forward to hearing from you.
