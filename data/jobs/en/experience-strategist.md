We are currently looking for an **Experience Strategist (f/m/d/-)** at our Frankfurt office.

We are looking for strategists who want to transform the digital transformation. Strategists who design and revolutionize the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative intuition.

### Your profile:

- Passion for digital topics, from use cases to organisational structures
- 2-4 years of strategy or service design experience at an agency or in the field of strategic customer consulting in a management consultancy
- Enjoy working in a multidisciplinary agency and client teams with a good understanding of highly agile working environment
- Strong interest and experience in communication formats and storytelling to bring complex issues closer to different stakeholder groups
- Experience in creating convincing presentations and workshop set-ups – and successfully representing them in front of the clients

### What we offer:

- Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
- Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
- Professional and personal development
- Creative exchange with your strategy team and the SinnerSchrader team
- Great benefits, a pleasant working atmosphere and short decision-making processes
