We are currently looking for an **Experience Strategist (f/m/d/-)** at our Frankfurt office.

We are looking for strategists who want to transform the digital transformation. Strategists who design and revolutionize the digital platforms of tomorrow on the basis of sound methods, professional know-how and creative intuition. You are the kind of person who looks radically through the eyes of the user and develops beneficial and innovative solutions that make everyday life simpler and – above all – better. You are therefore equally at ease with service and experience design as you are with the standard strategy repertoire. You have a keen sense of brands and their business challenges in the digital age. You also have excellent communication and methodical skills in addition to an analytical and inspiring mind.

- Strong interest and experience in communication formats and storytelling to bring complex issues closer to different stakeholder groups
- Experience in creating convincing presentations and workshop set-ups – and successfully representing them in front of the clients

### Who we are:

- You’ll join an international team with strategists from varied backgrounds, from sociologists to straight-up product strategists, from cultural omnivores to economists 
- Our broad spectrum of strategic capabilities as a team today, is owed to our diverse experiences, skills, cultures and personalities
- Our different backgrounds help us to understand, connect and translate between clients, client’s clients, colleagues and robots
- As varied as our backgrounds and skill sets are, so is the role you’re taking on as strategist. It will be shaped by and around you

### What we offer:

- Exciting and innovative projects for well-known companies
- Varied tasks and space for personal responsibility
