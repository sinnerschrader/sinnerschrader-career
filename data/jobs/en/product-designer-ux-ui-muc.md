- Ability to make and represent conceptual decisions
- Very good knowledge of User Centered Design, Interface and Interaction Design
- Ability to communicate and work in a team
- Empathy as well as being able to work on an abstract level
- Independent and accurate way of working
- Experience in industry-standard tools such as Sketch, Adobe CC, Invision, ProtoPie and Principles
