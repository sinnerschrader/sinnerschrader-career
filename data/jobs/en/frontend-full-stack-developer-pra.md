Dear candidate!

You seem to be curious about us so we will be fair enough to tell you openly about what is expecting you if you decide to apply.

First of all we are a company with the motto No Assholes. We endorse individuals and interactions over processes and tools in every project we have. #NoBullshit. What else?

- International fancy projects.
- Multicultural cross-functional teams.
- Travelling to Germany and other countries to meet with colleagues.
- Endless opportunities to grow and get responsibility if you see that potential in you!

Sounds interesting? Then keep reading if you‚Äújust want work on interesting projects with no alpha leaders and no beta teams‚Äù.

## About us

You can check us on www.sinnerschrader.com, read our bio here in StartupJobs or simply google us. You may also want to know that:
- We are around 55+ technological enthusiasts. Developers. QAs. UXs. Designers. Scrum Masters. And we want to grow fast in 2021! 
- We sit in Libe≈à in the office which was awarded ‚ÄúOffice of the year 2018‚Äù However due to pandemic we mostly use our own home offices which wasn't awarded yet :D 
- We work remotely with our German colleagues from Hamburg, Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt on cool projects for quite cool clients

## About projects?

There are two challenging opportunities at the moment:
- The first one is for enterprise content-driven project with high complexity for a German car manufacturer. You will have great chance to work full stack - from styles to containers and everything in between. It is also great chance to build microservices and microfrontends. Cool, isn't it? And our multinational Scrum team is willing to teach, mentor, and grow together with you - you will not be alone at all.
- The other is project for another large German car manufacturer that understand the reasons of an agile work. You will use your frontend skills to the fullest - it's complex project with a lot of space for learning new things (e.g. recently we started focusing on accessibility!). We have cross-located team, usually 5-8 people who are all looking forward to times when we can travel again between our offices (Prague and Hamburg) because it was always such a great team-building opportunity.

- Experience with React in bigger projects, cool would be TypeScript, Node.js, Java, CI/CD, unit testing, responsive design, code review, Cypress tests, CSS
- Familiarity with agile mindset & methods (Scrum, Kanban)
- Strong conceptual and analytical skills as well as a structured, proactive approach to work
- Team spirit in order to achieve goals together
