For our location in Hamburg, we are looking for a **(Senior) Visual Designer (f/m/d/-)**.

As a Senior Visual Designer, you love good design, no matter what format - you design a screen just as well and passionately as you illustrate a process or design a presentation. You have a feel for brands and can translate ideas, values and concepts into colours and typography. You enjoy delivering outstanding results in a pitch or in user-centred design sprints in the shortest possible time, but you also enjoy driving your own themes and inspiring teams.
 
### What you can expect from us: 
 
- Exciting topics around new client acquisition
- User-centred work in service design processes
- A highly motivated, small team within a large agency
- A good mix of large accounts and small clients
 
### Your Profile:
 
- A high level of creative ambition
- High demands on your work results
- A good eye for typography, colour and image worlds
- Fun with new and challenging tasks
 
### That's what we offer:
 
- A high level of personal responsibility, fast decision-making processes and flat hierarchies
- Exciting and innovative projects with well-known clients
- Varied tasks and room for your own ideas
- Personal and professional development in our SinnerSchrader Campus
- An innovative team
- Great benefits, a pleasant working atmosphere and fun at work
 
Please send us your application documents (including a link to your online portfolio) by email only to <jobs@sinnerschrader.com>. 
 
We look forward to hearing from you.
